## StardewMUI 5
The best Stardew Valley mod management solution, with a little complexity and a little preparation time, you will get unprecedented mod management efficiency.

Before starting, you should make sure you have learned the original method of installing mods, otherwise you may not understand this product.

SMUI does not replace SMAPI, you also need to install and update SMAPI as usual. But for mods, it is now a brand-new management method, you no longer need to copy and paste folders, and you no longer need to nest multi-layer folders, and you don't need to change folder names to note them. From now on, everything is handed over to SMUI. In the SMUI operating software, you can directly complete all daily management operations.

## Features
+ Installing and uninstalling mods is now just a keybutton or a click away.
+ Truly supports all types of mods, not just standard SMAPI mods, but also translation files, XNB replacements, content supplements, and non-mod content. etc.
+ Execution based on user programming, very simple commands.
+ Automatically preserve config.json, no need to reconfigure the mod every time you install and update.
+ Update your mod directly through the NEXUS WEB API, and supports automatic handling of many cases, you just need to wait for the program to complete. Available whether you are a member of NEXUSMODS or not.
+ Integrated global mod installation checker, which can directly check the status of all installed mods. Comes with an extensible save editor to edit your game saves efficiently and safely.
+ Support plugins, free extension function.

## WIKI
I don't have much time to maintain the [English Wiki](https://stardewmui.fandom.com/wiki/StardewMUI_Wiki), you can use machine translation to consult the [Chinese wiki](https://stardewmui.fandom.com/zh/wiki/StardewMUI_Wiki), or you can also help with some work on the English Wiki, just register an account to edit.

## Additional Components
Install **StardewMUI Chromium Embedded Framework** to use the browser function in the software. For non-NEXUSMODS members, you need to obtain additional parameters through the built-in browser to download mods. Since this component takes up a lot of space and does not need to be updated often, it is independent and becomes an optional installation.

You can download it on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UDZoHUOibIeFACRkn0ZI_DzaT_Zb4sA2?usp=sharing), run the installer and must install to the SMUI installation location, otherwise it will not work.

In addition, the version of this component needs to correspond to the version of SMUI. I will remind the version of the browser component that needs to be used in the new version of SMUI.
